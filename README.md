# Artemis
IoT malware that I'm writing for fun. 

### About
Name comes from the Athena malware which was a HTTP bot for windows.
Athena was the first botnet I ever "set up" and got me into malware and botnets.

## Server
	
PHP and bla BLA BLA add more later

## Client

The client side is IoT because C is the language I know best although I'm attempting to learn C++ now.
Client side is inspired from both [BashLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASHLITE) and [Mirai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)).

## Credits

Okay so I'm 100% sure I'm missing some but this is everything I've looked at that I've documented.
